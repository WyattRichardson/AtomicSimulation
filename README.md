# AtomicSimulation
  Use arrow keys to move positive atom up down and side to side. Use keys I and O for to move the atom in and out. Be sure to play around with the variables in the code like ATOMIC_ATTRAcTION_STRENGTH, ATOMIC_BOND_DISTANCE_MULTIPLIER, and the number of atoms and their charges. Notice how they reflect real molecule geometry like tetrahedral, linear, bent, trigonal planer, etc. Light position can be controlled with keys WASD.
